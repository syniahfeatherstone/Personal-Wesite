		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hello. My name is Syniah Featherstone. I am seventeen years old and go to Hollywood High. I love colorful and aesthetically pleasing things. I enjoy shopping and scrolling down my Instagram feed. I will be an A-List celebritity and feel destined for greatness. I am nervous and excited for senior year. I am at GWC to expand my knowledge and become a more well rounded person. I love to make new friends and see new places. Sometimes life is hard I mean everyone wants to be me. I don't even blame them. I mean look at me, I'm perf.</p>
